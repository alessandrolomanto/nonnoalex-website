As a child, my mother told me: "Don't make your classmates copy your homework after you have spent so much time on it." But no, **I disagree.**

**Hello world**, this is my first blog post. Why the origin of this blog?
Since high school I have learned that for me, the best method of fixing ideas is **WRITING**. And here I am, I want to collect my ideas, my studies and my curiosities in one place. And what satisfaction would it be if someone found them useful?

In this path I will try to document my personal Roadmap towards learning the DevOps methodology which aims not only at the study of particular tools but also at communication and collaboration.

I hope you like it!
